# MoviesDatabase

It is a web application, based on TMDB API.
As a user you can discover movies and tv shows by categories (e.g. popular, upcoming...etc.). 

(Future plan to add database for register/login, and make it more responsive!)

# Built with
* Javascript/React
* Bootstrap
* MS SQL and Entity Framework (for database connection in the future)

# How to use
On the main page you can choose by:
* Movies
* Tv shows
And their categories like:
* Upcoming
* Popular
* Top rated
.
.
.
etc.

When you click on a movie/tv show card, a modal window pops up with some more detail like overview, rating, release date.
Future plan is to add trailer video to the modal window.
